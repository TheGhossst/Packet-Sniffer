Below is a comprehensive, step-by-step roadmap for **Phase 1** of your IDS project. This phase focuses on laying a solid foundation by building the core pipeline—from capturing packets to processing them via a messaging system—using atomic components that can later be extended in Phase 2. Each atomic component is broken down with details on what to implement and how to do it properly.

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Pipeline Setup**

**Objective:**  
Establish a robust, decoupled pipeline that captures network packets using a high-performance Go service, buffers them in Redis, and processes them with a basic Node.js analysis worker. This phase validates that the data flows seamlessly from capture to analysis.

### **Timeline Overview:**
- **Week 1:** Environment & Foundation Setup  
- **Week 2:** Implement Go-based Packet Capture Service  
- **Week 3:** Build the Node.js Analysis Worker  
- **Week 4:** End-to-End Integration Testing & Documentation

## **Atomic Components**

### **Atomic Component 1: Environment & Foundation Setup**

#### **Tasks:**
- **Development Environment:**
  - Install **Go** (latest stable version) and **Node.js**.
  - Set up **Redis** (local installation or via Docker).
  - (Optional) Set up TimescaleDB for future storage but focus on Redis now.
  - Install **Npcap** on your Windows machine (ensure WinPcap compatibility).
- **Version Control & CI/CD:**
  - Initialize a Git repository for your project.
  - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests.
- **Containerization Prep:**
  - Write initial Dockerfiles (or Docker Compose files) for services to run in containers later.

#### **Deliverables:**
- A working development environment.
- Repository structure with clear directories for the Go service, Node.js service, and configuration files.

---

### **Atomic Component 2: Go Packet Capture Module**

#### **Objectives:**
- Capture live network packets efficiently using Go and gopacket.
- Serialize captured packet data (e.g., to JSON) for transmission.
- Publish packet data to Redis for decoupling the capture from processing.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Up a Go Project:**
   - Initialize a new Go module.
   - Install dependencies:  
     ```bash
     go get github.com/google/gopacket
     go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap
     go get github.com/redis/go-redis/v9
     ```

2. **Implement Packet Capture:**
   - Use gopacket to open a live capture on your designated network interface.
   - Parse basic fields (source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.).
   - Serialize the parsed packet into JSON.

3. **Integrate with Redis:**
   - Connect to the local Redis instance.
   - Publish each packet’s JSON to a Redis channel (e.g., `"packet-stream"`).

4. **Error Handling & Logging:**
   - Log errors from packet capture or Redis publishing.
   - Optionally, throttle the packet flow if needed.

#### **Example Code Snippet:**
```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "encoding/json"
    "log"
    "time"

    "github.com/google/gopacket"
    "github.com/google/gopacket/pcap"
    "github.com/redis/go-redis/v9"
)

type PacketData struct {
    Timestamp   time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
    SrcIP       string    `json:"src_ip"`
    DestIP      string    `json:"dest_ip"`
    Protocol    string    `json:"protocol"`
    PacketSize  int       `json:"packet_size"`
}

func main() {
    // Open live capture (adjust interface name as needed)
    handle, err := pcap.OpenLive("eth0", 1600, true, pcap.BlockForever)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer handle.Close()

    // Initialize Redis client
    rdb := redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{Addr: "localhost:6379"})
    ctx := context.Background()

    packetSource := gopacket.NewPacketSource(handle, handle.LinkType())
    for packet := range packetSource.Packets() {
        // Here you would parse the packet; for demo purposes, we create a dummy record.
        pd := PacketData{
            Timestamp:  time.Now(),
            SrcIP:      "192.168.1.1", // replace with actual parsing
            DestIP:     "192.168.1.100",
            Protocol:   "TCP",
            PacketSize: len(packet.Data()),
        }

        packetJSON, err := json.Marshal(pd)
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("Error marshaling packet:", err)
            continue
        }
        // Publish packet to Redis channel
        err = rdb.Publish(ctx, "packet-stream", packetJSON).Err()
        if err != nil {
            log.Println("Error publishing to Redis:", err)
        }
        // Optional: sleep to throttle high traffic
        time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
    }
}
```

#### **Deliverables:**
- A fully functioning Go service that captures packets and publishes JSON messages to Redis.
- Unit tests (or manual tests) to verify packet capture and Redis publishing.

---

### **Atomic Component 3: Node.js Analysis Worker**

#### **Objectives:**
- Subscribe to the Redis channel to receive packet data.
- Perform basic processing (parsing the JSON and logging or minimal analysis).
- Lay the groundwork for later expansion (e.g., multi-threaded analysis and integration with threat intelligence).

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Set Up a Node.js Project:**
   - Initialize a new Node.js project (`npm init`).
   - Install Redis client library (e.g., `redis`):
     ```bash
     npm install redis
     ```

2. **Create the Analysis Worker:**
   - Connect to Redis and subscribe to the `"packet-stream"` channel.
   - Process each message (for now, simply log the packet details).

3. **Integrate Worker Threads (Optional at this stage):**
   - If you expect some processing load, set up a basic worker thread to handle received packets.
   - For Phase 1, even a single-threaded implementation that logs the output is acceptable.

#### **Example Code Snippet:**
```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const subscriber = redis.createClient({ url: 'redis://localhost:6379' });

subscriber.on('error', (err) => console.error('Redis Client Error', err));

async function start() {
  await subscriber.connect();
  await subscriber.subscribe('packet-stream', (message) => {
    try {
      const packet = JSON.parse(message);
      console.log('Received Packet:', packet);
      // Further processing can be added here.
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Error parsing packet:', err);
    }
  });
}

start();
```

#### **Deliverables:**
- A Node.js service that successfully subscribes to Redis and logs packet data.
- Basic error handling and logging to validate the data flow.

---

### **Atomic Component 4: End-to-End Pipeline Integration & Testing**

#### **Objectives:**
- Validate that packets captured by the Go service are successfully received and processed by the Node.js worker.
- Ensure that the data flow is robust and that errors are handled gracefully.

#### **Implementation Steps:**
1. **Integration Testing:**
   - Start the Go capture service and the Node.js analysis worker concurrently.
   - Use sample network traffic (or simulate packets if needed) to verify the pipeline.
   - Log messages at each stage to monitor latency and potential bottlenecks.

2. **Monitoring & Debugging:**
   - Use logs and possibly simple dashboards (e.g., a terminal-based monitor) to track how many packets are processed.
   - Identify and fix issues such as message loss, JSON parsing errors, or Redis connection problems.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Write clear documentation for each component, including setup instructions, environment variables, and troubleshooting tips.
   - Prepare integration test scripts or instructions to replicate the end-to-end flow.

#### **Deliverables:**
- An end-to-end working pipeline from packet capture to logging via Redis.
- Documentation outlining how to run, test, and troubleshoot the pipeline.
- A test report summarizing the results of integration testing.
